# Project 3 - Facilities in the Hague

## Introduction

This is a software application that shows a list of facilities in The Hague for each neighborhood. It also offers various filter options. This program was developed as a school project 3 at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences (study Computer Science). We   started with 5 team members, but in the first couple of weeks 3 members stopped with their education.
